SUMMARY

    DiskEditor is a full function disk editor that supports (A) graphics or
non-graphics printing of all data displayed onto the screen (B) a DOS shell
(C) Directory: displaying, viewing, and editing, (D) On-Line Help, and
(E) Mouse support. Pressing the F1 function key or pressing both mouse
buttons (at the same time) will pop-up the main help screen. I hereby pro-
claim, being of unsound mind and body, this program a freebie. Enjoy!
Please send any suggestions or correspondences to the address shown below.

Syntax:   DE  [drive:]  [/f  /p  /mo  /ml  /mn  /ms  /h  /?]

       drive = Requested drive to view. If other than the default drive.
           f = Program generated formfeeds during full sector print-outs.
               Use ONLY w/ a laser printer or w/ continious feed paper!
               NOTE: Since the multitude of computer owners can't afford
                     to run out and buy the latest and greatest hardware,
                     am leaving this switch as is. At least until I take
                     the time to work out a coding solution.
               NOTE: All printer output is sent to LPT1, via INT 17h.
           p = Supports printing of additional extended characters 128-159.
               NOTE: Inserted this switch because older printers will not
                     treat these characters as the IBM Extended Character
                     Set, but instead will strip off the high bit and
                     treat these as printer control codes.
          mo = Disable initialization of the mouse driver.
               NOTE: Use this switch if DE aborts with the message,
                     "Error:    Mouse driver does not recognize the
                     installed mouse. Use /MO." Mouse drivers (even Micro-
                     softs) can sometimes exhibit some very erratic
                     behavior.
               NOTE: A mouse IS NOT REQUIRED to use this program. Even with
                     a mouse, all keyboard commands enabled. But using a
                     mouse does make this program easier to use.
          ml = Disable light pen emulation.
               NOTE: Use this switch if you have light pen emulation loaded.
                     Will be reenabled upon program exit.
          mn = Set mouse cursor at normal speed. Default is double-speed.
               NOTE: Use this switch if the mouse cursor moves too fast.
          ms = Set mouse cursor at half-speed.
               NOTE: Use this switch if /MN is still too fast.
      ? or h = This help screen.

ERRORLEVELS

     Errorlevels returned by this program are:

     0 = No errors.
     1 = Syntax requested or needed.
     2 = The drive you requested to view does not exist.
     3 = Invalid character entered. Must be letters A-Z or a-z.
     4 = Cannot find DEHELP.BIN!
     5 = Not enough free memory. Requires a minimum of 256k free.
     6 = Mouse driver does not recognize the installed mouse. Use /MO.
     7 = Sector size exceeds 4096 bytes.
     8 = Cluster size exceeds 128 sectors.

VERSION HISTORY

  v2.4   04/29/98  Initial release to ZDNET.
  v3.0   06/12/98  2nd release to ZDNET. 1st release to AOL.
                   1st release for shareware distribution.
         1.) Completed recoded the program (and interface) in order to
             handle large capacity drives and files.
         2.) Added <Ctrl-F6> TestCF, which allows you to load and run a
             sector (cluster) read test on just the "Current File".
             Whereas, <Ctrl-F7> FilTest performs a sector (cluster) read
             test on ALL directories and files.
         3.) Added a display of the current cluster number(s) being tested,
             via <Ctrl-F6> TestCF, <Ctrl-F7> FilTest, and <Alt-F7> SecTest.
             That way you'll know that that particular session IS actually
             doing something.
         4.) Increased the maximum sector size from 1024 bytes to 4096 bytes.
             Had intended to make this 8192 bytes, but the compiler wouldn't
             allow it. Will need to work out a solution (or overcoding
             compromise) for this.
         5.) Discovered (and corrected) a bug in the code that caused all of
             the sector testing sessions to run too slow and/or buggy.
         6.) Corrected the mouse routine that handled program exit if there
             were unsaved sector changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMERS

 1.) I hereby disclaim being of sound mind and body.
 2.) Any simialarity between this program and any marketed program is
     completely coincidental. I do not steal other peoples ideas!
 3.) All algorithms in this program are of mine own creation. Excluding bits
     and pieces of code taken from the multitude of programming books that
     I own (from MS Press, The Waite Group, McGraw-Hill, TAB, etc.).




                                                                 Page  4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDITS

     This program has been a pet project of mine since late 1988 or
early 1989 (I forget). Causing me to dig through whatever technical books
and magazines I can get my hands on in order to keep abreast of the latest
disk hardware specifications and the newest DOS function calls. This all
started from Peter Norton and John Socha's book "Peter Norton's Assembly
Language Book for the IBM PC." In the process of learning assembler, you
wrote a small disk editor program called DSKPATCH. So, if the interface
looks familiar, DSKPATCH was the basis. Originally my extended version was
called ED (for EDITDISK) until Norton Utilities came out with a program of
the same name.
     I had uploaded DE v2.4 to ZDNET just to see what kind of response I
would get and it was simply overwhelming. If anything, that motivated me to
at least make DE stable and useable for the multitude of PC platforms.
I would like to thank the staff at ZDNET (especially Dwayne, who reviewed
it) for the great write-up and response that they generated.
     I would also like to thank Aaron Baird, Ronnie Byrd, and Eric Neumann.
These are fellows that I work with, who are also programmers. They allowed
me to ramble on and on about my latest work to DE v3.0. Plus helped by
running DE through the treadmill, offering suggestions for improvement,
and proof-reading the documentation.
     I would also like to thank Buddy Piercy of Hacker Hut, whom I met at
a computer show in Knoxville, TN (EMAIL: hackrhut@usit.net). Buddy travels
the computer show circuit throughout the south and southeast, selling name
brand software. He also offers shareware software at $2.50 a disk, with well
done labeling that he generates himself. Buddy offered to distribute DE
for me, plus sharing it with other shareware venders that he knows, giving
DE far greater exposure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISCELLANEOUS

     This program is written entirely in MASM 5.1. Any suggestions ?

     This program is designed to read disks with 12 or 16-bit FATs only!
     Please do not attempt to edit DEHELP.BIN! As long as you run DE while
logged into the directory of DE.EXE and DEHELP.BIN #or# their directory is in
your PATH statement, DE will be able to locate DEHELP.BIN. As a side note,
DEHELP.BIN is created by another program that I wrote called DAT2BIN.EXE.
It is available from ZDNET (DAT2BIN.ZIP), and includes TESTD2B.EXE, plus
TESTD2B2.EXE with complete source code that shows how to take advantage of
a binary file to hold messages, pop-up help screens, etc.
     To anyone that downloaded v2.4 from ZDNET and found the program buggy
and limited, this corrects all of that. I hope that you find v3.0 satis-
factory! Please let me know.






                                                                 Page  5
MISCELLANEOUS (cont.)

     DE recognizes long filenames. However, long filenames are just a subset
of the 11 character maximum filename that they precede (come before) in the
Root Directory or a Sub-Directory. This is for backward compatiability with
12-bit and 16-bit code and DOS versions. The quantity of characters in a long
filename determines how many 32 byte long directory entries are used for just
that one filename. And it is stored as UNICODE. The only special field used
in each of its 32 byte directory entries is the "Attribute" byte. Its value
will always be 0Fh. FYI.
     To be added or enhanced are greater than a 4096 byte sector size,
completeing the cross-linked files routine, adding a hook to INT 24h for
when an empty drive bay is requested (the default DOS handler temporarily
takes control of the program and displays:
          Not ready reading drive x <---- A or B or whatever
          Abort, Retry, Fail?  (DOS v3.2- = Abort, Retry, Ignore?)
The only safe route then is to press "F", "I", or insert a disk and press "R".
ABORT will crash the program, leaving you with no command line cursor and
a useless active mouse cursor.), adding the capability to view and edit the
MBR (Master Boot Record), and someday a defrager.
     In v2.4's DOC file, I mentioned adding the capability to read from and
write to CD drives. Have since discovered that that would be unfeasable.
Since a CD's structure is completely different from that of a magnetic disk,
I would be better off writing an independent CD editor. No promises on this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FUNCTION KEY MENUS

     The four different Function Key Menus are shown below. They are for
visual reference only, if using the keyboard instead of the mouse. To toggle
to a different menu, from the keyboard, press either <F1>, <Shift-F1>,
<Ctrl-F1>, or <Alt-F1>. If pressed a second time, a pop-up help screen for
that particular menu will appear (except for <F1>, which will pop-up a
Main Menu of help topics).
     If using a mouse, left clicking over <F1> will toggle forward through
the menus. And right clicking over <F1> will toggle backwards through the
menus. To bring up a help screen, move the mouse cursor to an empty spot on
the screen, then press both the right and left mouse buttons at the same time.

MAIN MENU HELP SCREEN TOPICS

     At program start, either press F1 or press both the right and left mouse
buttons at the same time. This brings up a Main Menu of help topics. To view
one of the topics, either use the up and down arrow to move the highlight bar
to the desired topic and press Enter. Or use the mouse and double left click
over the desired topic. A right mouse click equals ESC (exit)!
     A "P" in the upper right-hand corner of any help screen means that you
can send its contents to the printer by pressing "P" on the keyboard, or by
a left mouse click on the "P" of the menu. If the printer is not On Line,
this will just beep the PC speaker.
