----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTOR? <Alone-F5>

     Enter new sector to view (ESC to abort) [0-xxxxxxxxxx]: _

Please note that the very first sector is actually SECTOR 0 !
The "Total Sectors:" display, at the lower left-hand corner of the screen,
is the total 1-based sector quantity. Which is how normal people count.
xxxxxxxxx = the maximum sector number that you can input, in decimal.
To input the desired sector number in hexidecimal, end it with an "h".
For example: 1111h<Enter>

If you have an individual file loaded for editing, the allowable sectors
are restricted to the sectors that belong to that file.
(This is done via <Alone-F7> FileDir, and the file is known as the
"Current File".) And the prompt would then be:

     Enter new file sector to view (ESC or ENTER alone to exit): _

     If there are unsaved sector changes, the procedure is the same as
<Alone-F10> Exit DE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRIVE?  <Alone-F6>

     To select a new drive, either user the right and left arrow keys to
highlight the desired drive letter and press Enter. Or Double left mouse
click over the desired drive to view. A right mouse click equals ESC (exit)!
     Please note, if you have a CD drive installed, its drive letter will
not be shown. Their structure and access methods (programming wise) are
entirely different from that of a magnetic disk.
     If the requested drive exceeds the limitations of this program, you
would see one of the messages below, and the drive change would be aborted.

             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             |   Error:  Sector size of requested    |
             |           drive exceeds 4096 bytes.   |
             +---------------------------------------+

             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             |   Error:  Cluster size of requested   |
             |           drive exceeds 128 sectors.  |
             +---------------------------------------+

     If there are unsaved sector changes, the procedure is the same as
<Alone-F10> Exit DE.

     NOTE: If you select a drive and the (floppy) drive bay is empty,
the default DOS INT 24h handler will temporarily take control of the system
and display:    Not ready reading drive x <---- A or B or whatever.
                Abort, Retry, Fail?  (DOS v3.2- = Abort, Retry, Ignore?)
The only safe route then is to press "F", "I", or insert a disk and press "R".
ABORT will crash the program, leaving you with no command line cursor and
a useless active mouse cursor!                                   Page 14

FILEDIR <Alone-F7> MENU

     The FileDir Menu is fairly powerful. The maximum number of files that
can be read and displayed, in each directory, is 1191. This includes, and
displays, 1.) Volume Labels, 2.) hidden files and directories, 3.) read only
files and directories, 4.) system files, 5.) long filenames, and 6.) erased
files (these begin with the E5h character).
     FYI. The first byte of a 32 byte directory entry being 00h (binary 0)
indicates that there are no more files in that directory. NEVER do this
yourself, or you may render any remaining files inaccessable!
     The "File: xxxx" display, at the lower left-hand corner of the screen,
shows exactly which 32 byte directory entry that the highlighted file or
<DIR> is, within the Root Directory sectors or the Sub-Directory cluster.
     The "LEGEND", at the right side of the FileDir Menu, is a simple help
screen of allowable key presses. If using a mouse, a right or left click
over any command, will execute that command.
     If the logged drive is empty of files, you would see this message:
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             |  There are no files to display!       |
             +---------------------------------------+
     To access and load a <DIR>, either move the highlight bar to the desired
directory filename and press Enter. Or use the mouse and double left or right
click over the desired directory filename. The maximum number of
sub-directory levels is 6. If an attempt is made to go any deeper, you would
see this message:
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             |            !!!  SORRY !!!             |
             |  The maximum nested level in viewing  |
             |         sub-directories is 6.         |
             +---------------------------------------+
     To load and initialize a particular file for viewing/editing, either
move the highlight bar to the desired file and press Enter. Or use the
mouse and double left or right click over the desired file. The selected
file then becomes the "Current File". To exit back to the FileDir Menu,
press either <Shift-F10> Exit CF or <Alone-F10> Exit DE.
     a.) The maximum number of file clusters that can be read, from the FAT,
         is 16,383. This would be a minimum file size of 8,388,096 bytes
         (with 512 bytes per sector and 1 sector per cluster). As far as I
         know, this minimum could only be accomplished with a 32-bit FAT.
         If the number of file clusters DOES exceed 16,383 you would see
         this message:
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             | Sorry!! Could not load all of the file|
             | clusters. This program can only handle|
             | up to 16,383 file clusters.           :
             +---------------------------------------+
         You would still be able to continue, but would not be able to
         access the entire file.

FILEDIR <Alone-F7> MENU (cont.)

     If the file or <DIR> is an erased file or <DIR>, and its starting cluster
has been re-allocated to a newer file, you would see this message:
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             | Sorry!! The starting cluster of this  |
             | erased file or directory has already  |
             | been re-allocated.                    |
             +---------------------------------------+
         NOTE: You must use <U>nerase in order to access and view the
               clusters of an erased file! If not, and the first cluster
               is still free, it is the only cluster that can be viewed.

FILEDIR <Alone-F7> UNERASE MENU - Unerase the selected file.

     If the number of clusters found or selected matches the number of
clusters required, as indicated by the files size, the prompt shown below
will appear, along with the filename and extension of the erased file or <DIR>.
Pressing ESC here will pass control back to the FileDir Unerase main menu.
To continue, enter the new first letter for the filename and press Enter.
If an invalid character is entered, the PC speaker will beep. Once a valid
character is entered, DE will update the Root Directory or the appropriate
Sub-Directory (with the new first character and the new file size; see below),
update the FAT(s), update the FileDir Menu, and then exit out of the
unerase session.

         Enter the new first letter (A-Z): _NERASE.TST

     If the number of clusters found or selected is less than the actual
number required, as indicated by the files size, you will see the message
below. Pressing "Y" to continue, will proceed as explained above, and the
file size will be updated accordingly.
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             | The number of clusters found is less  |
             | than what was originally allocated.   |
             | If you wish to continue, the files    |
             | size will also change accordingly.    |
             |                                       |

FILEDIR <Alone-F7> UNERASE MENU - Unerase the selected file. (cont.)

     If DE detects that you are trying to unerase within an erased sub-
directory, the message below will appear.
             +=|ESC|============================================+
             | ERROR: You cannot unerase a file or subdirectory |
             | that is nested inside of an erased subdirectory. |
             | The subdirectory must be unerased first!         |
             +==================================================+

     NOTE: If after unerasing a file or <DIR>, you exit to DOS, and the
directory that you are in is the same directory as the unerased file or
<DIR>, you will need to do this: 
         C:\>dir "the unerased filename.ext" <Enter>
The reason for this, is that DOS keeps an internal memory buffer of the
current directory. And unless DOS itself does the file handling, this
internal buffer is not updated. Therefore, DOS will not recognize the
newly unerased file or <DIR>! This forces DOS to update the buffer.

     NOTE: This has been successfully tested on an 18 megabyte Windows swap
file. With a partially fragmented cluster chain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEDIR <Alone-F7> UNERASE MENU - View Cluster data of the erased file.

     This option will load the erased file or <DIR> as the "Current File".
Not all Function Key commands will be allowed, but this allows you to:
1.) view the found or selected clusters/sectors, to see if they are valid,
and 2.) test the integrity of the clusters/sectors.
Press ESC to exit back to the Unerase Menu.

     In exiting back to the Unerase Menu, if there are unsaved sector
changes, the procedure is the same as <Alone-F10> Exit DE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEDIR <Alone-F7> UNERASE MENU - View Cluster numbers of erased file.

     Displays the erased file or <DIR>'s clusters and sectors. This IS the
<Shift-F7> CF Info menu. Press F1 for the help screen. Moving the highlight
bar to the cluster or sector to view, and pressing Enter, will load the
erased file or <DIR> as the "Current File" (see above).
Also see CF INFO <SHIFT-F7> for more information.
Press ESC to exit back to the Unerase Menu.

     In exiting back to the Unerase Menu, if there are unsaved sector
changes, the procedure is the same as <Alone-F10> Exit DE.







                                                                 Page 24
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEDIR <Alone-F7> UNERASE MENU - Omit Cluster(s) of the erased file.

     Will display the erased file or <DIR>'s clusters and sectors. Choose
the cluster that you want to omit and press Enter. Any cluster, except the
very first cluster, may be omitted. Remember that you have to use option #2
of the Unerase Menu in order to save the changes to disk. If you mess up
here, use the printer option so that you aren't restarting from scratch,
ESC all the way back to the FileDir Menu, and start over again.
     The "LEGEND", at the right side of the Omit Cluster Menu, is a simple
help screen of allowable key presses. If using a mouse, a right or left
click over any command, will execute that command.
     Press ESC, when done, to exit back to the Unerase Menu.
     Pressing F1 brings up the help screen below. If using a mouse, press
both the left and right buttons at the same time.
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             | Position the cursor over the desired  |
             | Cluster to omit and press <Enter>.    |
             +---------------------------------------+

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEDIR <Alone-F7> UNERASE MENU - Find Next Cluster of the erased file.

     Will parse the FAT (File Allocation Table) for the next free cluster.
Will either add the new cluster to the list or replace the last cluster
found (you cannot exceed the file size).
     If DE will need to replace the last found file cluster, with the new
free cluster, you will see the message below asking for permission to do so:
             +=|ESC|=================================+
             |  Replace the last cluster found ?     |
             |  Press Y if you wish to do so, else   |
             |  Press N or ESC to abort.             |
             |                                       |
             |                                       |
             |           Continue <Y/N> ?            |
             +=======================================+
     If there are no more free clusters, you will see the message below.
             +-|ESC|---------------------------------+
             |  The are no more available clusters!  |
             +---------------------------------------+
