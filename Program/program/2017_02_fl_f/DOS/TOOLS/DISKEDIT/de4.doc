STRNFAT <Alt-F4>

     Parses the cluster chain of all Directories and Files, in the logged
drive, comparing their cluster chain with the FAT (File Allocation Table).
And locating all clusters that are Strays (not associated with any file) or
that are Cross-Linked (two files are sharing the same clusters).
As the cluster chain of each Directory or File is parsed, it is displayed
as the "Current File". You will see the prompt below.
Choose the printer option by pressing "Y" or "N" on the keyboard, or a
left mouse click over the "Y" or "N". To abort, press "ESC" on the keyboard,
or a right mouse click. If "Y" is chosen, and the printer is not On Line,
and you press ESC (to abort the print-out), the session will continue.

     [F1=Help] Do you wish to have the output sent to the printer (Y/N) ?

Pressing "F1" on the keyboard, or a left mouse click over "[F1=Help]", will
pop-up the help screen below:

will show the Directory or File that is currently being parsed.
To abort this session, before it is finished, press ESC.

         >>>>  Locating Stray and Cross-Linked clusters in the FAT.  <<<<

     If there are Stray and/or Cross-Linked clusters found, the 2 examples
below show the format of what you would see.
NOTE: This is the only session in this program that is not yet complete.
But will at least detect, show the information on the screen, and send the
information to the printer. Once completed, will be able to unCross-Link
the found files. As a side note, if you have instances of both, then more
than likely at least some of the Stray clusters belong to one of the
Cross-Linked files.

CMPFATS <Alt-F6>

     Compares both copies of the FAT (File Allocation Table), of the logged
drive, for any differences. Both copies are supposed to be identical.
If there is only 1 FAT on the disk, will just beep the PC speaker.
FYI. DOS instituted there being a second copy of the FAT around DOS v2.
The intension was that if the first (or master) FAT were to be corrupted,
there would be a backup copy. The problem with this is that when DOS performs
file handling, both copies of the FAT are updated. Meaning that the second
copy is really useless. It is not a DOS requirement that a disk have 2 FAT's,
but RAMDISKS are all that I've ever seen that have only 1 FAT.

     After selecting the printer option, the prompt below will appear.
n/a  = we are not in the DATA sectors yet (where the cluster scheme begins).
xxxx = the cluster number (in hexidecimal) that is currently being tested.
The "Cluster: xxxx" display may seem to be skipping clusters, but it is not.
Since most clusters (groups of sectors) on a disk will be good, this program
takes advantage of DMA (Direct Memory Access) by reading large groups of
sectors at once. If an error occurs during one of these reads, the program
backs up, reads each set of clusters from that group in order to isolate
the bad cluster (aka, sectors within that cluster), and then goes to the next
large group of sectors. If the "Cluster: xxxx" is skipping along just fine,
and then starts to crawl through the cluster numbers, you'll know that DE
received a sector read error. If no read errors are reported to the screen,
and the "Cluster: xxxx" display starts to skipping along again, then the
magnetic field (called: flux) of the errant sector is probably getting weak.
A trick I learned a few years ago, with bad floppy disks, was to put the
disk in the drive bay, close the door, and leave it there for about 5 or 10
minutes. The heat generated within the computer case seems to energize the
magnetic field (flux) on the disk. Then is a good time to copy its contents
to a fresh disk. If in doing so, DOS brings up its infamous "<A>bort,
<R>etry, <I>gnore" message, choose <I>gnore. DOS will attempt to read a bad
disk sector 3 times before you see this message. And since DOS will always
assume a worse case scenerio, choosing anything but <I>gnore would be
fruitless. NEVER use DISKCOPY to transfere files from a bad disk to a good
disk. You will end up with a duplicate of the bad disk. Use COPY instead.
To abort the sector test, before it is finished, press ESC.

                                                                 Page 41

     The below is a sample of what you would see. With some sector read
errors thrown in. Please note that the sector numbers are displayed in
decimal and the cluster numbers in hexidecimal. The number that appears
after the sector number is the 1 or 2-digit error code that was returned
by the operating system. On a color moniter this error code will be yellow
and on a monochrome moniter, high intensity (real bright). If the print-out
option is chosen, the error code will be enclosed in brackets: [ 4].
NOTE: This session tests ALL sectors on the disk, whether the area they are
in is marked as bad in the FAT (File Allocation Table) or not. If you have
an older computer, it would be a good idea to run <Alt-F5> FndNFAT, with the
print-out option, the first time around. This will give you a print-out of
any clusters that are marked as bad in the FAT (this prevents DOS from using
these clusters).

press "ESC" on the keyboard. Or left mouse click over "ESC". To send its
contents to the printer, press "P" on the keyboard. Or left mouse click

NOTE: A sector error code of 4 does not necessarily mean that the sectors
magnetic field (flux) is about to fail. But if the sector test reports a
great number of these, its probably a good time to perform a complete backup,
and then low-level format the drive. This will restore the magnetic field of
the disk. Now if any other of the error codes are reported (6, 7, 8, 11, or
12), and the clusters that they are in are not marked as bad in the FAT, then
it would be very wise to have a professional PC technician examine the
circuitry of the drive. And if necessary, replace the drive.

Other programs by the author.

DAT2BIN.EXE  Converts an ASCII text file into an ASCIIZ binary file that
             may be used to hold messages for Pop-Up Help screens, etc.
             NOTE: DAT2BIN.ZIP includes DAT2BIN.EXE, TESTD2B.EXE, and 
             TESTD2B2.EXE with accompanying source code.

EDITENV.EXE  A general purpose utility that allows one to edit, delete, or
             add Enviroment Variables. This utility also expands the maximum
             length of an Enviroment Variable from 127 characters to 255
             characters! Pressing F1 while in the Variable or Editing Window
             will pop-up a help screen.

GMENU.EXE    A general purpose utility that is used to create custom "menu
             and shell" programs for games, utility programs, or whatever.

LISTDEV.EXE  v2.0 displays the Device Driver Chain and the contents of each
             Device Header. Redirection to a file or the printer is allowed.
             Source code included.

LISTIVT.EXE  v2.0, short for List the Interrupt Vector Table, provides a
             simple way to obtain the Segment:Offset addresses from the IVT
             in the first 1024 bytes of computer memory. A brief explanation
             of each Interrupt is also shown. For ease of use, the bottom most
             line is highlighted, showing the allowable key presses. An option
             for a print-out of the current screen or the entire IVT listing
             is provided via the F2 function key. A complete print-out is 10
             pages.

MEMSPY.EXE   A general purpose utility that is used to peek and poke around
             in memory. Output can also be sent to: [1] a file (binary image)
             or PRN > file or [2] to the printer, with options that accom-
             modate the capabilities of the printer being used.

PMENU.EXE    Displays a menu of choices for printer configuration. Press the
             appropriate key that is shown to the left of the wanted selection.
             In all cases, an uppercase letter = "Set" and where applicable,
             a lowercase letter = "Cancel".

PMENU_E.EXE  Is identical to PMENU.EXE except it adds an additional
             EPSON-specific command that allows the printer to be set to
             extended ASCII printing without physically changing a dip-switch.



                                                                 Page 45

SEC2FILE.EXE A general purpose utility that is used to copy the contents of
             of an absolute sector (or sectors) to an output file for viewing
             or editing. It is compatiable for any 12 or 16-FAT, with DOS
             versions 2.xx through 7.xx.

TESTATTR.EXE A general purpose utility that allows a programmer to see the
             colors that different "character attributes" generate,
             the easy way!
