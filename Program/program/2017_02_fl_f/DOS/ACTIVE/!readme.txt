BOOT-DSK.ISO is an ISO image for a bootable CD-ROM containing 
FreeDOS and Active@ Boot Disk utilities.


Registered copies of all DOS products (DOS executables) are located on the
bootable partition of the CD-ROM and thus are not accessible under Windows.
Documentation for all products, in PDF format, are located on the partition 
of the CD-ROM that is accessible under Windows.


To prepare the CD-ROM and run Active@ Boot Disk:

- Use any CD/DVD burning software (like Ahead Nero) to burn a CD-ROM ISO image
- Insert this CD-ROM into CD-ROM drive of the computer
- Check that the CD-ROM has boot priority over HDD in BIOS settings
- Re-boot the machine

The computer will boot in DOS mode and the Active@ Boot Disk menu is 
launched at startup.



Good Luck!
