Active@ Disk Image is a DOS-based backup 
solution designed for complete backup and 
restore of a whole HDD as well as particular
FAT / NTFS partitions and logical drives. 
A unique feature of the product is the
ability to open disk images and preview 
files and folders within an image before 
image restoration. 
In using Active@ Disk Image you can perform 
a backup of your PC system to another hard 
drive or to a network server storage 
location and then restore it in the event 
of a system crash or loss of important 
information.     
Furthermore, you can restore disk images 
created in other data recovery applications
for DOS and Windows such as Active@ UNERASER, 
Active@ Partition Recovery or Active@ UNDELETE.
